Latest updates v3.6+ are now live, introducing the updated Giveaway v2 Re-work alongside a bunch of awesome tweaks and improvements! 🔥

## Key Improvements:
- GW Buttons 🔳 - The new giveaway system uses buttons to register entries, which allows for improved checks as well as removes the need to require users to use DMs.
- GW Customisation 🛍️ - Three new parameters for giveaways, including description, captcha and serverage.
- GW Captcha 🤖 - By default, all new giveaways will run with the CAPTCHA check on, reducing the chance of botted entries.
- Verification System ✅ - Upgraded the Captcha system to an improved flow, including adding time out to prevent spam.

Check out [the giveaway feature page](../../docs/giveaway-feature) for more information about Giveaway System v2 usage.
