Our latest update v3.7 is now live, which brings a new AI Chat Conversation feature into Elite Bot! 🤖💬

You can now use Elite Bot to have a conversation with AI at any time. This is simply done through the **/aichat** command on any server with Elite Bot on it, for free and with no usage limits! 💪

Want to ask a question? Or simply summarise some information... no problem, ask the Elite Bot and you will promptly receive a detailed reply with all the info you need. 🔥

You can even select between private or public conversation replies, and set a conversation style for the bot, to make it either balanced, more creative or more precise. 🙌

Check out the [AI Chat Conversation feature page](../../docs/aichat-feature) for further detailed information! 🤓

Make sure to join the [Elite Group](https://discord.elite-bot.com) (support server) for further detailed project notes and to stay updated with the latest Elite news!
