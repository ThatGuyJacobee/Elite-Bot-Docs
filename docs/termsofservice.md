Elite Bot ("us", "we" or "our") operates https://elite-bot.com (the "site") & Elite Bot Discord Bot (the "bot"). This page informs you of our terms and conditions for usage of the Site and Bot.

## The Basics of using Elite Bot

As of currently, all configuration for Elite Bot occurs through the built-in commands, which means that we do not require/rely on authentication within this Site. This means that the only time you must login via Discord is when adding the bot directly through the Discord OAuth prompt.

Ultimately, you as the user control how much information is accessible and stored on our database servers, depending on what you configure and enable through the Bot.

By using Elite Bot, you represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age (or have consent from a parent/guardian) to form a binding contract.

You will only use the Bot for your own personal, internal and non-commercial use. If your use of the Bot is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren't authorized to use the Bot. We cannot and won't be responsible for you using the Bot in a way that may break the law.

## Restrictions of usage on Elite Bot

By using Elite Bot, you represent, warrant and agree that you will not contribute any content/submission or otherwise use the Bot in a manner which may:

- Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights.
- Violates any law or regulation.
- Be dangerous, harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory or obscene.
- Jeopardizes the security of your or someone else's account.
- Violates the security of any network to illegally access any content without authorization.
- Attempts to decompile or reverse engineer to obtain the source code for the Bot.

If you are found breaking any of the above restrictions, we reserve the right to permanently blacklist you from using the Bot and/or delete any inappropriate and outstanding content that is not permitted from our database servers. We may also report illegal activities to the appropriate Law Enforcement agencies.

## Your rights whilst using Elite Bot

Any materials that is displayed or available through the Bot are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You must abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information and restrictions contained in any materials and won't copy, reproduce, modify, sell or commercialize without explicit permission of the content owner.

Subject to Our Terms of Service, we grant each user a non-exclusive, non-transferable and worldwide license to use the Bot for free. Through the license, you promise to abide by the Terms of Service that we have set out.

## Changes to this Terms of Service

The Terms of Service is effective as of 21/09/2022 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Terms of Service at any time and you should check this Terms of Service periodically. Your continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the Terms of Service on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Terms of Service.
