## How does this work?

Through the giveaway feature, you can easily create giveaways within your guild, with a range of customisation including timing, requires roles, minimum account age requirements and more! There are total of four utility commands related to giveaways which used to create and manage giveaways within your guild which can be seen in the table below!

| Command        |    Example    |  Usage  |  Permission  |  Timeout  |
| -------------  | :-----------: | -----  |  ----------  |  -------  |
| /giveaway start        | /giveaway start [duration] [prize] [winners] [#channel] [Optional: description/captcha/accountage/serverage/requiredrole/pingusers] | Start a new giveaway for your guild. | Manage Events | 30 secs |
| /giveaway edit        | /giveaway edit [giveawayid] [Optional: changeprize/description/winneramount/captcha/accountage/serverage/requiredrole/addtime/subtime] | Edit the prize of a giveaway now within your guild. | Manage Events | 30 secs |
| /giveaway end        | /giveaway end [giveawayid] | End a giveaway now within your guild. | Manage Events | 30 secs |
| /giveaway reroll        | /giveaway reroll [giveawayid] [howmany] | Re-roll a giveaway within your guild. | Manage Events | 30 secs |

## Starting a giveaway

Beginning a giveaway is an easy process, the command requires a duration, prize, winners amount and the channel as essential parameters. The other couple of parameters are all optional to be used if you wish!

## Editing a giveaway

Likewise with the start command, you can edit any part of the giveaway via the appropirate parameter. The most important part is the Giveaway ID, which can be found in the footer of the giveaway embed! You don't have to fill all of them, they are all option so only set a parameter for what you want to edit!
