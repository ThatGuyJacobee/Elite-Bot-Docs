## Configuring the Welcome Feature

Next you need to configure the Welcome Feature for your guild! There are a few options that you can pick from. 

From the parameters, you must select a channel which you wish to set as your welcome channel. The other three parameters are options. You can if you wish set an embed title, description and also select an image if you wish to show a fun image graphic within the embed!

You can use the "/welcome config" command which conists of the four arguments allowing you to set it up just as you like it!
