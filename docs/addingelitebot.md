## Recommended Permissions üëç
In order for the bot to function correctly, certain permissions must be granted for Elite Bot when being invited to your server, or must be edited if Elite Bot is already in your server.

The table below, presents all of the permissions that Elite Bot required in one way or another based on the feature-set and commands currently available. Beside each permission, the Elite Bot feature, module or command which requires the permission is described to provide a clear reasoning for each permission.

:::warning
We do NOT recommend providing any bot or user with **Administrator** permission privilage, including Elite Bot. This is because the Administrator permission grants access to everything on your server which is extremely unnecessary, but also unsafe.
